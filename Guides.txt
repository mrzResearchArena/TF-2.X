Gist:
[1]. Keep in mind "Machine Learning" is just high-dimensional geometry.
[2]. Machine Learning is the logical and experimental science.

CNN, is for the computer vision.
RNN, is for the sequence data (time series, text, speech, biological sequences, stock prediction).
GAN, generate realistic images (even people/object doesn't exist in this planet).
DRL, is for the gaming model.
NLP, is for the speech recognition and machine translation.

Z1 = relu(XW1+b1)
Z2 = relu(Z1W2+b2)
Z3 = relu(Z2W3+b3)

Z = relu(relu(relu(XW1+b1)W2+b2)W3+b3)
